# Project: Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to take a static restaurant reviews webpage with minimal functionality and build it into something more useable and visually appealing. This was accomplished first by making the site fully responsive and ready for mobile use on all devices. Next, basic features were added to make the application more accessible for screen readers and other users who may have impairments. Finally, a service worker adds data caching for better user experience when offline.
